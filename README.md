This website was created using Reactjs and has been deployed to https://cocktailyapp.netlify.app/

On Cocktaily you type an ingredient name (ex: wine, vodka etc) and you get a list of cards with different cocktails. If you click on a card you can see what other ingredients you need, measurements for the ingredients and how to prepare the cocktail.
